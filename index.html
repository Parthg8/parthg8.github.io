    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>There is a bathtub-like container in the mystery black box that emits an output based on the amount of water inside the container.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>
      The mystery black box is a container in which a mechanism makes certain amounts of water travel from an input to an output source. Initial observations noted included water flowing in, and different amounts of water flowing out. There was a funnel from which water could go in, and a pipe sticking out at the bottom of the container from which water could flow out so we understood how the system worked. Based on the data and observations such as hearing the water as it traveled through the box, we built a model based on our belief that the mystery black box was like a bathtub. It had a drainage system, and water kept piling up until it reached a certain level, and when it did, certain amounts of water came out. More water in after it has reached its level, more water becomes an output. The opposite is true as well, we believe. Our testing methods and model were quite faulty. We continually got fewer amounts of water as an output than our input values. For example, on trial 1, we got 150mL as an output, even though we put in 500mL as an input. This pattern was true for all of our data.
