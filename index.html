    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>There is a bathtub-like container in the mystery black box that emits an output based on the amount of water inside the container.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>
      The mystery black box is a container in which a mechanism makes certain amounts of water travel from an input to an output source. Initial observations noted included water flowing in, and different amounts of water flowing out. There was a funnel from which water could go in, and a pipe sticking out at the bottom of the container from which water could flow out so we understood how the system worked. Based on the data and observations such as hearing the water as it traveled through the box, we built a model based on our belief that the mystery black box was like a bathtub. It had a drainage system, and water kept piling up until it reached a certain level, and when it did, certain amounts of water came out. More water in after it has reached its level, more water becomes an output. The opposite is true as well, we believe. Our testing methods and model were quite faulty. We continually got fewer amounts of water as an output than our input values. For example, on trial 1, we got 150mL as an output, even though we put in 500mL as an input. This pattern was true for all of our data.    
    </p>
    <h1>Reasoning</h2>
    <p>
      There is indeed a bathtub/sink like container within the mystery black box. Reverberating sounds from inside the box can be heard as water is poured down the funnel, somewhat like plastic. One concept that I would like to get across is the fact that there had to be a container in the black box. This is because there could not have been a ramp or just a small system of pipes that went (for the most part) directly from input to output. This is because at certain points when water was poured in, none came out. There had to have been a container storing all of it. Once the water reaches a certain level, a pressure plate must be activated, releasing a lot of water at once, like a bathtub. Or like a sink, as sometimes when the water level reaches a level, it just leaks out through a drain higher up. This can be supported by the fact that at certain times when a little bit of water was deposited, a lot more water would be returned.

    <h3>What is a Model?</h3>
    <p>
      Models are physical representations of ideas that help the builder visualize their thinking. While they may help the builder understand the strengths and weaknesses of their plan and thinking, they are not a full-on, working thing that is the same thing as an original. Essentially, they do not work like a prototype, thus, they may be too simple.
    </p>
    <h2>Counterclaim</h4>
    <p>
      There is a system of pipes that lead to the output pipe. I would have observed how the pipes were organized. Perhaps, there was a dip at a certain point, where water could be stored unless a lot of water came in and steadily poured water out. There would have been another pipe that had water stored as well, that way when sudden outbursts of water came in, only some would come out, but when the level of water would be high and only a little bit of water would go in, a lot more water would be able to come out. We had actually predicted this outcome, but did not go through with it because it was a faulty one. We heard reverberations through the funnel, and we thought that our idea would be more feasible. Thus, this does not mean anything for our claim, as our claim is superior in our minds.
